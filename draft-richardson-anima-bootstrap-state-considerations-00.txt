Considerations for stateful vs stateless join router in ANIMA bootstrap
        draft-richardson-anima-bootstrap-state-considerations-00

Abstract

   This document explores a number of issues affecting the decision to
   use a stateful or stateless forwarding mechanism by the join router
   (aka join assistant) during the bootstrap process for ANIMA.

1.  Introduction

   The [I-D.pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] defines a process to
   securely enroll new devices in an existing network.  It order to
   avoid providing globally reachable addresses to the prospective new
   network member, it assumes that a Join Router.  The role of this
   router is common in this kind of architecture.

1.1.  Terminology

   EAP [RFC5247], 802.1X and PANA [RFC5191] use the term Authenticator
   to refer this role.

   The Thread architecture [threadcommish] uses the term Joiner Router

   The 6tisch architecture ([I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology]) uses the term
   JA, short for Join Assistant.

2.  Purpose of the Joiner Router/Join Assistant

   This device is one layer-2 hop from the new device.  In addition to
   whatever secured networks it might connect to, it runs a sufficiently
   unprotected network (either physical or wireless) such that a new
   device can connect at layer-2 without any specific credentials.

   The new node runs a discovery protocol as explained in
   [I-D.pritikin-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] to find an address for a
   registrar to which it can run the Enrollment over Secure Transport
   (EST, [RFC7030].  EST runs RESTfully over protocols such as HTTP.

   The new node does not have a globally routable address, so it can not
   speak directly outside the current link.  This an intentional
   limitation so that the new node can neither be easily attacked from
   the general internet, nor can it attack arbitrary parts of the
   Internet.

   The Joiner Router provides a limited channel between the new node,
   and the Registrar.  This document is about the various options and
   considerations that need to be considered when chosing this limited
   channel.

   An additional goal of this document is to outline which methods could
   be interchangeably be used by private negotiation between the Joining
   Router and the Registar, without the knowledge of the New Node.
